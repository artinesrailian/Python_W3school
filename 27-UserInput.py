#The method is a bit different in Python 3.6 than Python 2.7
#Python 3.6 uses the input() method
#Python 2.7 uses the raw_input() method
UserName = input("Enter username:")
print("Username is: " + UserName)

#Python stops executing when it comes to the input() function, and continues when the user has given some input
